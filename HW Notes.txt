yes i submitted in bcs late (7am wed) but it's only bc i forgot that part. it was uploaded in github at 620 on tuesday.
but then i went in at some point wed to look at a piece of code and MY HOMEWORK WAS GONE.
if this is phillip reading this, it's bc we deleted my old local folder. i had to recover it and then 
repost. i hope this all makes sense. so it probably looks like i posted super late but my old folder issue
took time to notice and then fix.thanks.
